Original
* I need a cohesive easy to manufacture finished design
    * Pay some fiver designers to come up with concepts within the given constraints
    * Find designers on instagram to take design farther, refining making sure they work within manufacturing ease?
* Visual industrial design
    * Constrain designs by manufacturing considerations
CONSTRAINTS
* Take dimensions and give as constraints
* Weight must be as light as possible. must be the same or lighter as current construction
    * Could maintain weight goals by making disassembleable
* Must maintain ability to fold up
    * Deck and chair must hinge to collapse
    * Could also be flat packable by disassembleable
* Adjustable back and footrest
    * Be able to adjust backrest angle to change riding posture
        * How would this affect having a curved/more narrow seat?
    * Footrest angle should be adjustable and foot deck position movable
* The electronics exist already on the market just a matter of bespoke for product
* The software exists already via vesc but can be reverse engineered to be bespoke

FOOTREST
    * SUPPORTS   
        * Foot deck must be slid able along supports
        * How to make deck hinge able? currently using cog and tooth gear or lawn chair locking hinges needs to be adjustable and lockable so it doesn’t hit people in face tipping backwards
        * Bonus points if foot support removable 
        * Can it be 1 deck support instead of two? Something to test
        * When legs are on deck how much flex should be allowed? 
        * I think the benefit of the two support legs is steering it allows you to put more pressure on the edges, but made more narrow so your feet could go down, so a tradeoff between easy of leg lowering and leg steering ability
        * Torsion on single leg vs down and side pressure from two
        * Hinges probably don’t need to be in each leg could be bracketed and that have the hinge
        * End caps of legs or how they fluidly mesh in to foot deck
    * DECK
        * What about underside and how it looks when seen in motion? 
        ATTACHING DECK TO SUPPORTS AND MAKING LENGTH ADJUSTABLE
        * How should the deck be mounted to supports? 
            * Does run in to occasional forces landing on ground. 
            * Currently through bolted which does protect the supports so maybe put caps on the end? Like onewheel slide plates that are disposable? 
            * Or can flush mount 
            * doesn’t need to be quick release but might be nice to push button to slide and adjust. 
            * Lock around round tubes like bike seat bracket to slide up and down
            * will have multiple holes to adjust length of foot rest
            * or could put multiple holes in supports. 
            * Or no holes in either and just use friction bracket
            * or screw in from bottom and have bunch of mount points on underside? 
        DECK MATERIAL
        * Should deck be curved at all? 
        * should have relatively smooth top to allow for easy foot adjustment by sliding around
        * Deck is currently plywood, 
            * could be skate deck wood
            * or molded reinforced nylon, 
        * Deck should be rounded to prevent shin scrapes. Should be sturdy to resist foot pressure forces
        * Should have deck minimum current dimensions
        * Width of deck also adjusts leverage which adjusts steering so riders might like extra wide decks for more foot control, so possible aftermarket parts of wider/narrower deck
        * Would be nice for bottom to be beautiful and cohesive 

CHASSIS
* Mount bracket from motor to frame
* What type of tubing or milled aluminum should frame be?
* Ease of tire change
CHAIR
* How to attach frame to chair? 
    * Through bolt through chair hinge? 
    * Serrated locking plate style? 
* Ensure user butt doesn’t hit tire, 
* ensure user is well cushioned and supported
* leaning differences of having a straight bar across the bottom vs the bent out brackets probably affect the hinging/leaning/aka steering abilities and the ability to steer by leaning. how far out should hinge point be so turning is changed? 
* Currently uses polyethylene fabric like lawn chairs to offer lightweight suspension/cushion
* need to consider when user hits bumps 
* Just order seats from supplier of heavy duty current one with specifications but get them custom hinges that can handle load are adjustable and attachable to frame
* BACKREST
    * It’s fun to make backrest adjustable but is there an optimal curve that should be fixed and used? More of a shifter car race bucket seat?
    * Backrest nice for it to be adjustable, don’t really put head on it as is, stops being useful at should height so maybe taper in and angle forward to support rider head more? 
    * Back of chair should look cool? Place to express yourself as rider? 
    * What about different torso riders?  Should probably have flag mount or other visual safety feature for visibility from cars, 
    * Seat back need crossbar for potential wheelie bar mounting location?
* SEAT
    * Chair seat dimensions make sure legs don’t poke users thighs while feet on ground, maybe could be rounded in like bike bike seat or recumbent bike seat? 
    * If fabric seat should it be like the lawn chair? To attach fabric?,
    * Bonus pointsSeat base a way adjust its angle relative to ground
    * Seat base collapses from fabric tension atm so will need to be stronger or have cross bar
* HANDLEBARS
    * Handlebars need to be longer than  current should they be foldable?
    * Handlebars are good in current location but need to be longer, also what changes occur with physics of ride if move to mounted at chair hinge point? 
THROTTLE
* Throttle should it be thumb, twist or other? If throttle is twist what happens on leaning on turns will that be okay or affected? 
* How would breaking be with thumb drive? Would it need brake lever too then? 
* Should it have power/kill switch on it? 
* Should it have lcd/battery indicator? 
* Should it be bluetooth or wired in? If wired how to run cable to battery box discretely? What about if it’s tri ride style?
ELECTRONICS/BATTERY/BMS/COMPUTER
* Battery and computer box, 
* visually nice
* fender proximity for stuff getting stuck?
* how it opens or changes for repair
* how it mounts to frame
* charge port 
* kill switch 
* wiring harness motor connection
* BMS
* battery
* computer
* ferrite ring, 
* waterproof
* battery upgrade? 
* Bigger battery version? 
* Bemf considerations, 
* What happens when chair is folded?
* what happens if foot support removable? 
* TRI: And chair supports modifiable? ie extendable for chair, or removeable for luge although dont think they need to be removed for luge

SAFETY/VISIBILITY
* LED lights for nighttime visibility aftermarket
* Safety flag spot for visibility
* Safety wheelie bar to prevent flipping if no actual wheelie bars on chair

QUESTIONS/TANGENTS/CONSIDERATIONS
* Should it be amendable to after market parts?
* Put vision on it and map and start training autopilot for it
* Rounder tire for easier turning
* Serrated locking plate style?
* Add pressure sensors on parts to test loads?
* How to manufacture? Assembly line? Machine that builds the machine. 
* How/cost to ship? 
* What amount of assembly for end user? 
* What type of paint finish? 
* What type of packaging? 
* Different model types? Base vs premium. 
* What type of customer? Who is interested in spending 1500-4k on a recreational electric vehicle? 
* Kid version? 
* How to address balance issues when coming down weird things at weird speeds?
* Would be fun to have a wrist control throttle so you can start stop hands free.

AFTERMARKET PARTS
* wider/narrower deck
* LED lights
* Handlebar extenders/height adjusters aftermarket
* different battery box covers
* different throttles
* Aftermarket seat adaptions, different materials/colors/angles/sizes.

TO TEST
* single vs double support on footrest
* handlebar physics of force of side of seat vs hingepoint vs other location, what changes occur with physics of ride if move to mounted at chair hinge point? 
* Should deck be curved at all? 
* effects of attachment style of chair and effects on steerability
